<<<<<<<<<<<  Types of Databases  >>>>>>>>>>>


1.	Comparison Chart: Create a comparison chart between Relational and Non-relational databases. Include at least three differences and three examples of each.



Feature	        |   Relational Databases	    |  Non-Relational Databases
                |                               |                              
Data Structure  |    Tables with rows           |    Varied structures e.g. 
                |       and columns             | documents, key-value pairs, graphs
                |                               |
Schema          |   Fixed schema (data must     |   Flexible schema (data can
                | follow predefined structure)  |  be stored in any format)
                |                               |
Data            | Use primary and foreign keys  |  Use different methods (embedding,
Relationships   |  to establish relationships   | linking) to relate data
                |                               |
Examples	    |   MySQL, PostgreSQL,          |  	MongoDB, Redis, 
                |        Oracle                 |      Cassandra




 2.	Research: Write a summary on what MySQL is, including its features and typical use cases.

 MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL  to manage and manipulate databases.
