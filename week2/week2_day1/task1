<<<<<<<<<<<  Understanding Databases  >>>>>>>>>>>

1.	Research and Write: Write a short essay on what a database is. Explain the concept in your own words.

A database is a way to store and organize data so it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

Instead of having lots of paper files, you have digital tables that hold data in rows (records) and columns (fields). Each table stores information about a specific topic, like books in a library .


2.	SQL Basics: Write a brief explanation of what SQL is and its importance in managing databases.


SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a programming language used to interact with databases. It's how you ask a database to show you information, add new data, update existing data, or delete data you don't need. 

SQL commands:

<!--SELECT: Retrieves data from the database.-->
SELECT title, author FROM Books;

<!--INSERT: Adds new data to the database.-->
INSERT INTO Books (title, author) VALUES ('the alchemist', 'Paulo Coelho');

<!-- UPDATE: Changes existing data in the database.-->
UPDATE Books SET author = 'Paulo Coelho' WHERE title = 'the alchemist';

<!--DELETE: Removes data from the database.-->
DELETE FROM Books WHERE title = 'the alchemist';
