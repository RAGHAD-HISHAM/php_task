Task 7: Null and Not Null Constraints
1.	Explanation: Describe the difference between NULL and NOT NULL constraints with examples.

NULL Constraint
        A column defined with the NULL constraint can store NULL values, representing missing or unknown data. This is the default behavior if no constraint is specified.
    Use Case:
      Useful when a value for a column might not always be known or applicable.

NOT NULL Constraint:
        A column defined with the NOT NULL constraint must contain a value; it cannot be NULL. This ensures that a column always has valid data.
    Use Case:
        Useful for columns where data is mandatory, such as primary keys, foreign keys, and essential attributes.
