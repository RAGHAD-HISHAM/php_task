•  Task 14
•	Objective: Understand and create many-to-many relationships.
•	Exercise: Write SQL queries to create tables students, courses, and student_courses to represent students enrolled in multiple courses and courses having multiple students

CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id)
);


CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    course_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (course_id)
);


CREATE TABLE student_courses (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(course_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
